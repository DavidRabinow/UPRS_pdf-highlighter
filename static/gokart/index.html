			<h1>The go kart: </h1>
			<u><h3>Objective</h3></u>

<h5>My goal was to construct a go-kart entirely from wood, a material not typically used for this purpose. This unconventional choice allowed me to explore principles of materials engineering.</h5>
	
	<u><h4>Planning</h4></u>

	<h6>Design Sketch: I began by drawing a basic outline of the go-kart to conceptualize its structure.</h6>

		Dimensioning: To determine exact measurements, I outlined the go-kart dimensions directly on my floor using tape, ensuring a clear and accurate layout.
</h6>

			<h6 class="mb-5">I decided on specific dimensions (5 feet long by 3 feet wide) for the go-kart.</h6>
			<h3>After purchasing the necessary materials, I had the wooden pieces cut to size.</h3>

			<h4>The rear axle, essential for connecting the wheels and enabling their rotation, was my first focus. Due to initial budget constraints, I selected a cost-effective axle. However, this came with challenges:</h4>
			<ol></ol>
			
			<b><ol>
				<li> T8F chains were unavailable.</li>
				<li> The clutch used on standard go-kart engines was incompatible with T8F chains</li>
			</ol></b>

			<u><h5>Clutch Analogy:</h5></u>

				<h6>Imagine you're on a merry-go-round. As it spins faster, you feel pushed outward due to centrifugal force. Similarly, in a centrifugal clutch:
				As the engine spins faster, centrifugal force pushes brake shoes outward.
				These shoes grip the clutch housing, transferring power from the engine to the wheels.
				</h6>

			<u><h5> Proposed Solution for the Sprocket Issue</h5></u>

			<h6>My first idea was to purchase a sprocket that could attach to the T8F sprocket, combining its teeth with a 420 sprocket to achieve compatibility with the clutch and chain system. (I just bolted the two sprockets together)
			</h6>

			<u><h5> Steering System</h5>
			</u>
			<h6>To address steering challenges, I first studied how a steering system works:</h6>

			<img src="go kart rack and pinion 2 of 2.png" class="mb-5" height="256" width="300">

			<h6>I designed and 3D-printed a piece to stabilize the entire steering assembly and prevent unnecessary movement.</h6>

		<h6>Using the rack-and-pinion mechanism, I developed a method to translate its movement into wheel turns:
		</h6>
		<h6>When one side of the system was pulled during a turn, it caused the corresponding wheel to turn inward, directing the go-kart appropriately.</h6>

		<u><h5> Material Challenges</h5></u>
		
		<h6>Because the plastic components I initially 3D-printed snapped under weight, I decided to have the same parts made out of steel for added durability and functionality.</h6>
