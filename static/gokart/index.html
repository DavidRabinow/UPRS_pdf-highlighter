      <h1>The go kart:</h1>
      <u><h3>Objective</h3></u>

      <h5>
        My goal was to construct a go-kart entirely from wood, a material not
        typically used for this purpose. This unconventional choice allowed me
        to explore principles of materials engineering.
      </h5>

      <u><h4>Planning</h4></u>

      <h6>
        Design Sketch: I began by drawing a basic outline of the go-kart to
        conceptualize its structure.
      </h6>
      <img src="go kart drawing.png" class="mb-5" height="256" />
      <h6>
        Dimensioning: To determine exact measurements, I outlined the go-kart
        dimensions directly on my floor using tape, ensuring a clear and
        accurate layout.
      </h6>

      <img src="go kart tape.png" class="mb-1" height="256" />

      <h6 class="mb-5">
        I decided on specific dimensions (5 feet long by 3 feet wide) for the
        go-kart.
      </h6>
      <h3>
        After purchasing the necessary materials, I had the wooden pieces cut to
        size.
      </h3>
      <img src="go kart wood.png" class="mb-5" height="256" />

      <h4>
        The rear axle, essential for connecting the wheels and enabling their
        rotation, was my first focus. Due to initial budget constraints, I
        selected a cost-effective axle. However, this came with challenges:
      </h4>
      <ol></ol>

      <b
        ><ol>
          <li>T8F chains were unavailable.</li>
          <li>
            The clutch used on standard go-kart engines was incompatible with
            T8F chains
          </li>
        </ol></b
      >

      <u><h5>Clutch Analogy:</h5></u>

      <h6>
        Imagine you're on a merry-go-round. As it spins faster, you feel pushed
        outward due to centrifugal force. Similarly, in a centrifugal clutch: As
        the engine spins faster, centrifugal force pushes brake shoes outward.
        These shoes grip the clutch housing, transferring power from the engine
        to the wheels.
      </h6>
      <div class="mb-5"></div>
      <u><h5>Proposed Solution for the Sprocket Issue</h5></u>

      <h6>
        My first idea was to purchase a sprocket that could attach to the T8F
        sprocket, combining its teeth with a 420 sprocket to achieve
        compatibility with the clutch and chain system. (I just bolted the two
        sprockets together)

      <u><h5>Steering System</h5> </u>
      <h6>
        To address steering challenges, I first studied how a steering system
        works:
      </h6>

      <img src="go kart steerin 1.png" class="mb-5" height="256" width="300" />
      <img
        src="go kart rack and pinion 1of2.png"
        class="mb-5"
        height="256"
        width="300"
      />
      <img
        src="go kart rack and pinion 2 of 2.png"
        class="mb-5"
        height="256"
        width="300"
      />

      <h6>
        I designed and 3D-printed a piece to stabilize the entire steering
        assembly and prevent unnecessary movement.
      </h6>
      <img
        src="go kart 3-d printed rack and pinion holder.png"
        class="mb-5"
        height="256"
      />
      <img src="better steering.jpg" class="mb-5" height="256" />
      <h6>
        Using the rack-and-pinion mechanism, I developed a method to translate
        its movement into wheel turns for go karts:
      </h6>
      <h6>
        When one side of the system was pulled during a turn, it caused the
        corresponding wheel to turn inward, directing the go-kart appropriately.
      </h6>
      <img src="my mech.jpg" class="mb-5" height="256" />
      <u><h5>Material Challenges</h5></u>

      <h6>
        Because the plastic components I initially 3D-printed snapped under
        weight, I purchased the same parts made out of steel for added
        durability and functionality. I then purchased a giant piece of steel
        square tube and had it cut to size. I then had this piece of tubing
        weldded to the spindle mechanism.
      </h6>
      <img src="my piece steel.png" class="mb-5" height="256" /><img
        src="steel tube.png"
        class="mb-5"
        height="256"
      />
      <h5>Brakes</h5>
      <img src="brakess.jpg" class="mb-5" height="256" />
      <h6>
        Every vehicle needs brakes—that's obvious. However, when it came to
        go-karts, the options were limited. I initially purchased hydraulic
        brakes, but over time they proved insufficient. So, I switched to
        mechanical brakes. Both systems operate similarly in that they use two
        steel plates to clamp onto a brake disc. The key difference is that
        hydraulic brakes use fluid pressure to engage the pads, while mechanical
        brakes use a direct mechanical linkage—one pad remains stationary as the
        other is pushed against it.
