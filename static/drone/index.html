            The drone is custom-built with a 3D-printed frame designed in Fusion
            360. The frame is lightweight and reinforced with carbon fiber tubing
            for durability. The motor mounts required multiple iterations to
            withstand vibrations, and a custom adapter was designed to securely
            attach the propellers to the motors. The landing gear is also carbon
            fiber, with a removable 3D-printed mounting system for easy transport
            and repairs. For wire management, a 3D-printed ESC holder keeps the
            components organized and accessible. The build is still being refined,
            but it is near completion.
          </p>

        <ol>
          <b>Frame</b>
          <div class="image-container">
            <p>
              The main part of the drone's frame is 3D-printed. I designed this
              part and all the other components using Fusion 360, a computer
              modeling software, and then 3D-printed them. The frame is
              lightweight, weighing less than a pound. The arms of the drone are
              made from carbon fiber tubing, which is extremely durable while
              still being lightweight. To prevent the tubes from spinning inside
              the 3D-printed frame, I drilled a hole and inserted a screw to
              secure them.
            </p>
            <img src="frame.jpg" class="mb-1" alt="Drone Frame" />
          </div>

          <p>Motor to Propeller Adapter</b>
          <div class="image-container">
            <p>
              The propellers I had were not compatible with the motors because
              there was no way to attach them securely. The motor would spin
              inside the propeller without actually turning it. To address this
              issue, I designed a custom adapter that allowed me to mount the
              propellers to the motors effectively.
            </p>
            <img src="adapter1.jpg" class="mb-1" alt="Motor to Propeller Adapter" />
            <img src="adapter2.jpg" class="mb-1" alt="Motor to Propeller Adapter" />
          </div>

          <b>Motor Mount</b>
          <div class="image-container">
            <p>
              For the actual motor mount, it took many iterations of design.
              When the motor would spin up, it tended to instantly break the
              mounts, so I had to redesign due to vibrations. To prevent the
              motor mount from spinning on the carbon fiber tube, I designed it
              with a screw hole at the points where the bottom of the motor
              attaches to the 3D model, reinforcing those areas.
            </p>
          </div>

          <b>Landing Gear</b>
          <div class="image-container">
            <p>
              For the landing gear, I wanted it to be made from carbon fiber due
              to its strength, durability, and light weight. I designed these
              3D-printed mounts that can easily be removed and attached for
              transportation purposes or in case the landing gear gets damaged.
              The mechanism is a two-part design, with the top and bottom parts
              attached with M3 screws, able to hold a piece of carbon fiber
              tubing at the bottom. It's not completely finished yet, but I'm
              almost done with the landing gear.
            </p>
          </div>

          <b>Drone ESC Holder</b>
          <div class="image-container">
            <p>
              The ESC (Electronic Speed Controller) has a multitude of wires
              connecting to various components, such as the four motors and the
              receiver for the drone. It is also positioned next to the battery.
              It was important that all the wires are easily accessible in case
              something goes wrong while maintaining neat wire management. I
              therefore designed and 3D-printed a holder for it, but I think it
              still needs some work before it's complete.
