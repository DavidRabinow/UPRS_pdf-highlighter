      <h4>
        The drone is custom-built with a 3D-printed frame designed in Fusion
        360. The frame is lightweight and reinforced with carbon fiber tubing
        for durability. The motor mounts required multiple iterations to
        withstand vibrations, and a custom adapter was designed to securely
        attach the propellers to the motors. The landing gear is also carbon
        fiber, with a removable 3D-printed mounting system for easy transport
        and repairs. For wire management, a 3D-printed ESC holder keeps the
        components organized and accessible. The build is still being refined,
        but it is near completion.

            <u>Frame:</u>
            <div class="mb-1" div></div>
            The main part of the drone's frame is 3D-printed. I designed this
            part and all the other components using Fusion 360, a computer
            modeling software, and then 3D-printed them. The frame is
            lightweight, weighing less than a pound. The arms of the drone are
            made from carbon fiber tubing, which is extremely durable while
            still being lightweight. To prevent the tubes from spinning inside
            the 3D-printed frame, I drilled a hole and inserted a screw to
            secure them.

          <li>
            <u>Motor to Propeller Adapter</u>
            <div class="mb-1" div></div>
            The propellers I had were not compatible with the motors because
            there was no way to attach them securely. The motor would spin
            inside the propeller without actually turning it. To address this
            issue, I designed a custom adapter that allowed me to mount the
            propellers to the motors effectively.
          </li>

          <li>
            <u>Motor Mount:</u>
            <div class="mb-1" div></div>
            For the actual motor mount, it took many iterations of design. When
            the motor would spin up, it tended to instantly break the mounts, so
            I had to redesign due to vibrations. To prevent the motor mount from
            spinning on the carbon fiber tube, I designed it with a screw hole
            at the points where the bottom of the motor attaches to the 3D
            model, reinforcing those areas..

          <li>
            <u>Landing Gear</u>
            <div class="mb-1" div></div>
            For the landing gear, I wanted it to be made from carbon fiber due
            to its strength, durability, and light weight. I designed these
            3D-printed mounts that can easily be removed and attached for
            transportation purposes or in case the landing gear gets damaged.
            The mechanism is a two-part design, with the top and bottom parts
            attached with M3 screws, able to hold a piece of carbon fiber tubing
            at the bottom. It's not completely finished yet, but I'm almost done
            with the landing gear.

              >Drone ESC Holder:
              <div class="mb-1" div></div></u
            >The ESC (Electronic Speed Controller) has a multitude of wires
            connecting to various components, such as the four motors and the
            receiver for the drone. It is also positioned next to the battery.
            It was important that all the wires are easily accessible in case
            something goes wrong while maintaining neat wire management. I
            therefore designed and 3D-printed a holder for it, but I think it
            still needs some work before it's complete.
