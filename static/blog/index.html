			<p>Yesterday i had this running but today i had to redo it sadly</p>
			<p>i also met this really pretty girl on the plane but well see if she texts back </p>
			<p>Its like 11pm and yk when u dont have enought time to study so u just turn on some music but then u only fucos on the music. But at the same time u dont want to turn off the music ya feel me?</p>
			<p>i guess ill keep you updated throughout the night</p>
			<p>i must lock in yessir</p>
			<p>POV: called by your principal wanting to "meet" so now i gotta prep for all the possible questions and not its also even harder to study ebc its like well whats the meeeing about what did i do wrong and bringing in the basketball coacj whne i havent attended practice like what am i supposed to do oh well </p>
			<p>did i mention theres a new "black kid" in the school so i guess i try to welcome him to the best of my capabilitie</p>
			<h6><u><b>2/11/2025</b></u></h6>
		<p>I think im going to officialy start this thing called 1% every day this can include working out,studying,CAD or even doing my blog > the goal of this is when is by the end of the year to see a signifcant improvemnt in myself</p>
		<p>and btw she still hasnt texted and its been like 2 days so... i think i might have to give up on her -issue= age gap-</p>
			<p>she texted back but nothing intresting better than being ghosted tho</p>
			<p>i think im not gonna respond for the next 2 days minimum and im unhinged with my conspiracy theories like taking the black kid hope i do well on my science test tho</p>
 		<p>alsos the book teh hatchet seems intresting but the way the movies put together seems extremely impressive</p>
		
		<h6><u><b>2/12/2025</b></u></h6>
